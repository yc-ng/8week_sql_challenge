## Setup 

Data for each case study is stored in their own schema in a local PostgreSQL database.

Schema and tables for each case study are created using the SQL code provided in the case study webpage (refer to the sections named *Interactive SQL Session*). A copy of each schema's SQL codew is stored in this repository for reference:

- [Case Study 1 Schema](case_01/schema_01.sql)
- [Case Study 2 Schema](case_02/schema_02.sql)
- [Case Study 3 Schema](case_03/schema_03.sql)
